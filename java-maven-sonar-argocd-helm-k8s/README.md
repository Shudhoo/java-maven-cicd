Today I worked on this Java Based application which is build using maven and have a CICD Pipeline follwoing DevSecOps Pratices !
The Ultimate Pipeline has phases like ( GitHub-Webhook ) -> ( Maven ) -> ( SonarQube ) -> ( Unit Tests ) -> ( Docker Build and Push ) = Continuous Integration
The Aother part which is Continious Develivery is done using ArgoCD ( Docker Hub ) <- ( ArgoCD Controller ) -> ( Kubernetes Manifests )

This is the flow of my Jenkins Pipeline .
